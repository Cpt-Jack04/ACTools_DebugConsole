    <b>For easy updates, use the following git URL through the Package Manager: https://github.com/mob-sakai/UpmGitExtension.git</b>
    <br/>
    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you could use a submodule as well, but I can't help you with that.</i>
    <br/>
    <b>In the Package Manager, use the following git URL: https://github.com/Cpt-Jack04/ACTools_Core.git</b>
    <br/>
