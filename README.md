## ACTools: Debug Console
<p>
    This debug console is based on Game Dev Guide's Debug Cheat Console: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzOEM-4A2OM&t=0s.
<p>
    This debug console tool is for developers to create debug commands to can use during the game to make it easier to debug and test the game.
    <br/>
    Feel free to use it for whatever. If you wouldn't mind, please credit me. It would be appreciated!
</p>

## Installation:
<p>
    Make sure the new input system and text mesh pro are in your package, otherwise this package will not work.
    <br/>
    At the moment, you will need to download a .zip file from a release, unzip it, and then import the .unitypackage file into the assets folder in your project. Hopefully, I will be able to get this package working with the UPM in the future.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Be sure that the package is installed in your assets folder and you should be all good at that this point. You can check to documentation file for how to create your own debug commands.
